# Machine_learning

Machine learning Project - mRNA expression DATA
Data set: gene expression cancer RNA-Seq

 

Preprocessing (Unsupervised learning):

- Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

- Clustering 

 

Use different classification methods (Supervised learning):

- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Linear Models

- Naive Bayes Classifiers

- Decision Trees

- Kernelized Support Vector Machines(?)

 

Goal: select the best classification method -> test the method (discuss)
