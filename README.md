# Machine_learning
Machine learning Project - mRNA expression data

##Goal
Select the best classification method -> test the method (discuss)

##Dataset
Gene expression ([RNA-seq](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/gene+expression+cancer+RNA-Seq#)) of five different cancer types.

##Methods
 
Preprocessing (Unsupervised learning):

- Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

- Clustering 

Use different classification methods (Supervised learning):

- K-Nearest Neighbors

- Linear Models

- Naive Bayes Classifiers

- Decision Trees

- Kernelized Support Vector Machines(?)

## TODO
Keep track on what we still have to do. Please update this list with new todo's. 

- [ ] Update README.
- [ ] Investigate preprocessing that is applied to the data.
- [ ] Write about preprocessing steps in report.
- [ ] Keep track on references in the report.
- [ ] Reorganize repository (give logical filenames, restructure folders, etc.).
- [x] Rewrite PCA scripts structure.
- [ ] Calculate amount of PC's needed (PCA script).
- [ ] Review PCA script (especially investigate explained variation values).
